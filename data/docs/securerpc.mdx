# SecureRPC 

> Supported RPC and API Endpoints for SecureRPC

## Overview

> v1.0.0 SecureRPC

## Block parameters:

When you make requests that might have different results depending on the block accessed, the block parameter specifies
the block. Methods such as `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex` have a block parameter.

The block parameter can have the following values:

`blockNumber` : quantity - The block number, specified in hexadecimal or decimal. 0 represents the genesis block.  
`earliest` : tag - The earliest (genesis) block.  
`latest` : tag - The last block mined.  
`pending` : tag - The last block mined plus pending transactions. Use only with `eth_getTransactionCount`.

## Subscribing

Use `eth_subscribe` to create subscriptions for the following event types:

- New headers    
- Logs    
- Pending transactions    
- Dropped transactions    


## Logs

To notify you about logs included in new blocks, use the logs' parameter with `eth_subscribe` or `mev_subscribe`.    
Specify a filter object to receive notifications only for logs matching your filter.

Logs subscriptions have a filter object parameter with the following fields:

`address` - (optional) Either an address or an array of addresses. Returns only logs created from these addresses.    
`topics` - (optional) Returns only logs that match the specified topics.    
`fromBlock` - (optional) The earliest block from which to return logs.    
`toBlock` - (optional) The last block from which to return logs.    

If a chain _reorganization_ occurs, the subscription publishes notifications for logs from the old chain with the
removed property in the log object set to true. This means the subscription can publish notifications for multiple logs
for the same transaction.

## Response RPC Methods

These are methods we support for which we return static responses to ensure compliance
