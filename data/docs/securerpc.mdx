# SecureRPC 

> Supported RPC and API Endpoints for SecureRPC

## Overview

> v1.0.0 SecureRPC

## Block parameters:

When you make requests that might have different results depending on the block accessed, the block parameter specifies
the block. Methods such as `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex` have a block parameter.

The block parameter can have the following values:

`blockNumber` : quantity - The block number, specified in hexadecimal or decimal. 0 represents the genesis block.  
`earliest` : tag - The earliest (genesis) block.  
`latest` : tag - The last block mined.  
`pending` : tag - The last block mined plus pending transactions. Use only with `eth_getTransactionCount`.

## Subscribing

Use `eth_subscribe` to create subscriptions for the following event types:

- New headers    
- Logs    
- Pending transactions    
- Dropped transactions    


## Logs

To notify you about logs included in new blocks, use the logs' parameter with `eth_subscribe` or `mev_subscribe`.    
Specify a filter object to receive notifications only for logs matching your filter.

Logs subscriptions have a filter object parameter with the following fields:

`address` - (optional) Either an address or an array of addresses. Returns only logs created from these addresses.    
`topics` - (optional) Returns only logs that match the specified topics.    
`fromBlock` - (optional) The earliest block from which to return logs.    
`toBlock` - (optional) The last block from which to return logs.    

If a chain _reorganization_ occurs, the subscription publishes notifications for logs from the old chain with the
removed property in the log object set to true. This means the subscription can publish notifications for multiple logs
for the same transaction.

## Response RPC Methods

These are methods we support for which we return static responses to ensure compliance

### SecureRPC MEV Transaction

```
manifold_sendTransaction
```


## 3rd Party Compatible APIs

SecureRPC's third party compatibility APIs require an active membership.
[securerpc.com/request-invite](https://securerpc.com/request-invite/).

The following APIs are designed to be API compatible with different
third party endpoints. Responses are intended to be "happy path
compatible" with the third party endpoints - that is under some error
conditions responses may not be exactly identical. Additionally, in some
cases where aggregations or estimates are involved responses may not be
identical, but should be comparable and fit for the same purposes.
Additionally, our APIs will generally provide addresses in checksummed
format.


## Etherscan Compatible

SecureRPC implements the following Etherscan compatible APIs. 
All Etherscan compatible API calls are of the form:

```bash
    https://api.securerpc.com/eth/api?module=$MODULE&action=$ACTION
```

With additional parameters to be documented below.

### Account Transaction List

Returns transactions and receipt data where the specified address is
either the sender, recipient, or the contract created by a transaction.

```bash
    curl 'https://api.securerpc.com/eth/api?module=account&action=txlist&address=0xdde19c145c1ee51b48f7a28e8df125da0cc440be'
```

The following parameters are available:

| **Key** 	| **Value** 	| **Description** 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| address  	| (required) 	| The Ethereum address to look up related nft transfers. 	|
| startblock 	| (default 0) 	| The beginning of the block range to inspect. 	|
| endblock 	| (default 99999999) 	| The end of the block range to inspect. 	|
| offset  	| (default 10000) 	| The maximum number of records to be returned. 	|
| page  	| (default 1) 	| The page number (assuming each page has a size of offset) 	|
| sort 	| (default asc) 	| Whether records should be sorted ascending (asc - earliest records first) or descending (desc - oldest records first). 	|


<div class="note">
<div class="title">

ðŸ“– NOTE.

</div>

The behavior of the `isError` field of transactions within this API is
not documented by Etherscan, and our implementation differs in some
cases. We define `isError` to be `true` if the transaction reverted, or
failed for other reasons (such as invalid opcodes), and `false`
otherwise.

</div>

pieces of information about the transaction in which the token transfer
occurred.
