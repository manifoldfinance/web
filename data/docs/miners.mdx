### Flashbots MEV Geth

Flashbots has designed and implemented a proof of concept for permissionless MEV extraction called MEV-Geth. It is a sealed-bid block space auction mechanism for communicating transaction order preference. Their proof of concept has incomplete trust guarantees, yet we believe it's a significant improvement over the status quo. The adoption of MEV-Geth should relieve a lot of the network and chain congestion caused by frontrunning and backrunning bots.

### Design goals

- **Permissionless**
  A permissionless design implies there are no trusted intermediary which can censor transactions.
- **Efficient**
  An efficient design implies MEV extraction is performed without causing unnecessary network or chain congestion.
- **Pre-trade privacy**
  Pre-trade privacy implies transactions only become publicly known after they have been included in a block. Note, this type of privacy does not exclude privileged actors such as transaction aggregators / gateways / miners.
- **Failed trade privacy**
  Failed trade privacy implies loosing bids are never included in a block, thus never exposed to the public. Failed trade privacy is tightly coupled to extraction efficiency.
- **Complete privacy**
  Complete privacy implies there are no privileged actors such as transaction aggregators / gateways / miners who can observe incoming transactions.
- **Finality**
  Finality implies it is infeasible for MEV extraction to be reversed once included in a block. This would protect against time-bandit chain re-org attacks.
