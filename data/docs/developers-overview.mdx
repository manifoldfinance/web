# Developer Overview

**Front-running protection:** transactions will not be seen by hungry sandwich
bots in the public mempool. **No failed transactions:** transactions will only
be mined if it doesn't include any reverts, so users don't pay for failed
transactions. Note: transactions could be included in uncle blocks, emitted to
the mempool, and then included on-chain. **Priority in blocks**: transactions
sent via Flashbots are mined at the top of blocks, giving them priority.
**Etherscan integration:** users can see the status of their transactions on
Etherscan.
