# OpenMEV RPC

> Supported RPC and API Endpoints for OpenMEV

## Overview

## Response RPC Methods

These are methods we support for which we return static responses to ensure
compliance

<pre>
  eth_chainId
  eth_protocolVersion
  net_version
  web3_clientVersion
</pre>

## Supported RPC

These are all methods we expose and proxy to our internal eth clients

<pre>
  eth_blockNumber
  eth_call
  eth_estimateGas
  eth_gasPrice
  eth_getBalance
  eth_getBlockByHash
  eth_getBlockByNumber
  eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash
  eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber
  eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex
  eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex
  eth_getTransactionByHash
  eth_getTransactionCount
  eth_getTransactionReceipt
  eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex
  eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex
  eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash
  eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber
  eth_sendRawTransaction
</pre>

### OpenMEV Transaction

Same signature as `eth_sendRawTransaction` but the tx is eligible for arb and
goes into our OpenMEV workflow (e.g. gas rebate). Anything received via
`eth_sendRawTransaction` just gets relayed

```
manifold_sendTransaction
```
