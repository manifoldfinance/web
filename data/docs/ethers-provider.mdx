# ethers.js provider

> ðŸš§ Work in Progress Section

ethers-provider-openmev-bundle is a repository that contains the `OpenMevBundleProvider` ethers.js provider to provide
high-level access to the `eth_sendBundle` rpc endpoint on mev-relay.

openmev-enabled relays and miners expose two new jsonrpc endpoint: `eth_sendBundle` and `eth_callBundle`. Since these
are brand-new, non-standard endpoints, ethers.js and other libraries do not natively support these requests (like
`getTransactionCount`).

In order to interact with these endpoints, you will also need access to another full-featured (non-Flashbots) endpoint
for nonce-calculation, gas estimation, and transaction status.

This library is not a fully functional ethers.js implementation, just a simple provider class, designed to interact with
your existing ethers.js v5 module.

```ts
// Force page refreshes on network changes
{
  // The "any" network will allow spontaneous network changes
  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum, 'any');
  provider.on('network', (newNetwork, oldNetwork) => {
    // When a Provider makes its initial connection, it emits a "network"
    // event with a null oldNetwork along with the newNetwork. So, if the
    // oldNetwork exists, it represents a changing network
    if (oldNetwork) {
      window.location.reload();
    }
  });
}
```

At a minimum, most applications that support network changes will want to `provider.removeAllListeners()` on network
changes, and re-establish their events.
