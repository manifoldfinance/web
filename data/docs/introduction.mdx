## Motivation

Manifold Finance enables and provides access to high-value transaction pools on EVM compatible chains, through our
infrastructure: _SecureRPC_. We aggregate multiple endpoints along with maintaining direct access to disparate mining
pools/validator nodes.

> In short, we believe that access to transaction sets will be **the defining advantage for block builders** in

> needs to build from high-value transactions. **The combined value of MEV opportunities at any point in time will in
> general outweigh any delta that could be obtained by smart block building algorithms, so access to a high-value

This appears to create a positive feedback situation, leading to the end result of a single large high-value transaction
pool, and a single major builder. Smaller transaction pools may survive if backed by validators willing to sacrifice
financial rewards for some other value, however for validators that are monetarily-driven they will end up taking the
block from the single major builder.

**OpenMEV** is built and operated by Manifold Finance. We are working towards the goal of creating a _credibly neutral_
block builder such that there won't be a single major builder that _will_ threaten consensus on-chain.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality is having a clear and comprehensive
rulebook that regulates off-chain behavior and activities. Our assumption concerning governance is that methods and
processes that work in legacy markets may not be applicable in adversarial environments such as permissionless
blockchains. With that understanding it is important not to rely soley on such systems and mechanics long term.
