# Q1 Summary

Q1 Summary Report is published before our Q2 Guidance report in which we will outline key objectives and milestones that
ought to be realized within that fiscal quarter.

In the first quarter of 2022 two major actions were taken that impacted us the most, these actions where:

- Rewriting the entire Internal Virtual Mempool, Trade Engine and Executor from 0

- Restructuring of organizational structure and operations

### Junk it: OpenMEV core logic

I originally proposed this as a way of us being able to compare our existing implementation against a less 'bespoke'
solution. Our original implementation utilized kdb+, a highly-performant in-memory database engine with a APL language
called 'q' that is used for querying, transforming, executing, etc against the database. The issue really with kdb+ was
its lack of open source developer community (we had rationalized this away by having support from First Derivatives, the
company behind kdb+ and q), and (at the time) its lack of external language support (NOTE: kdb+ and q now support Python
without performance loss, this only came out in March 2022). Furthermore, we of course had to develop our own toolin for
EVM specifics, below are three libraries written in C and q specifically for making the EVM play nice with kdb+

- https://github.com/manifoldfinance/qBigInt
- https://github.com/manifoldfinance/qAbiEncode

By framing the 'rewrite' as a way to benchmark our existing solution it wouldn't be seen as a time sink, rather an
important piece of kit that we could use in negotiations vis a vie the licenses for kdb+.

6 weeks later, the changes are unambiguous. The original reason we had chosen to go with kdb+ is because we had seen it
more as a liquidation engine than an arbitrage engine. We are also grateful for our new engineering peers, Antony and
Jörg for without them, it would not have been made to look so easy.

### Reorg the Org: are we CEOing yet?

In December, I decided to step-down as CEO because of two reasons:

1: The role of CEO at the scaling phase is much different from at the founding/incubation phase. It is much more bizdev
oriented. 2: With a high-profile CEO we could have an easier time finding talent, integrations, investors, etc. A social
media presence is a must ontop of having industry 'clout'.

The first reason is really informed by the fact that Ethereum Proof of Stake would be coming in late 2022 early 2023,
and if we were to position ourselves such that we can leverage the impending 'triple halvening' and other PoS effects,
having a dedicated technical point person would be necessary. These types of roles are also hard to fill as the payoff
very far in the future, which may or may not be realized in the end.

The second reason really speaks volumes of the state of head-hunting and our industry as a whole. Talented engineers are
not strictly motivated by monetary compensation. Interesting problems, conducive work environments can go a long way,
but in the end I have seen that associations with popular people really do matter. Yes, what I really am saying is it
is, in fact, more important to be liked than to be right. Also, working with well known people give a certain prestige
and more importantly, provides a much greater surface area for networking.

However, the only way to attract these types of high-value and high-impact people are only at the senior most roles.
Also, it can not be seen that they are not in control: the reigns have to be given to them, wholeheartedly. So, stepping
down as the CEO as founder is a non-trivial ask, but at the end of the day the success of the organization must come
before any perceived ego. I know this was the right decision because within a week of making it we had found the
'missing link'.

There is no more CEO role, and its important to be recognizing that. We are in a particular moment in time, witnessing a
new area of computer science blossom before our eyes in real time. We can't expect that the well-established parts of
operational management and theory will be the key ingredients (again) in making a firm successful.

Future generations of computer scientists, engineers, traders, etc, will be jealous of the opportunity we have to get in
on the first floor of this new area—analogous to getting into the Internet and the Web in the early 1990s. It only makes
sense that we take this opportunity and go with it.

### Q2 Expectations

While we had been rewriting the OpenMEV business logic (the virtual mempool and arbitrage engine), we actually have been
able to expand the usage of the aggregation layer for flashbots-enabled mining pools. This has lead to identifying the
non-OpenMEV part of the infrastructure as `SecureRPC`.

SecureRPC offers transaction routing to selected mining pools, all flashbots enabled mining pools, or simply just to all
of our downstream endpoints. This is useful for trading firms who are trying to execute trades on certain trading pairs
that are filtered out of the gateway (read: they are rejected), wanting to reduce uncle/orphan rate of their
transactions, or implement some other MEV-protected use case.

#### SushiSwap

Over the last 2 weeks we have solidified and fixed numerous issues with Sushi's frontend. These issues were preventing
Sushi from actually running SushiGuard on the application by default. That is no longer the case anymore. SushiGuard is
now on-by-default. Alot of these issues fell into two categories:

- Poor gas pricing on the user-side leading to too low of priced transactions. This is fixed, with a more substantive
  solution being finalized within the next week.

- Poor error reporting and the inability to provide meaningful error messages back to end users.

For the error reporting issues, part of this was infrastructure and part was frontend. We are now able to populate error
messages from wherever the transaction is having an issue, meaning directly from the mining pool gateway that is
rejecting the submitted transactions.

> see https://github.com/manifoldfinance/libsushi/blob/master/src/core/isTransactionState.ts

Our Transaction State status messages are derived from the flashbots status API specification.

- UNCHECKED -> Tx status has not been checked and there's no information about it.
- PROCESSING -> Tx checks are in place until a resolution happens: OK, INDETERMINATE, ERROR.
- OK -> Relay received the Tx && all downstream miners accepted without complains && tx mined successfully
- INDETERMINATE -> Relay received correctly the Tx && at least one miner accepted the TX && TX potentially mineable
- ERROR -> Relay haven't received the TX || none of the miners accepted the Tx || Tx was not mined successfully

We are also redesigning our initial SDK and libraries. For a example, a reference library, `libsushi` exists. The
preliminary code can be found via
[https://github.com/manifoldfinance/libsushi](https://github.com/manifoldfinance/libsushi)

On the strategy side, we are developing in tandem with StakingV2 (we need a better name) BentoVault strategies. These
revenue sharing strategies will be porting existing Yearn strategies to BentoVault that utilize $SUSHI. The reason for
this specific focus first is so that when protocols like Yearn go to harvest, they typically are dumping this tokens
over only a few blocks.
